My recent work has focused on multimodal AI, more specifically in the space of Deep Generative Models (Diffusion Models, GANs) and model understanding. Currently, Iâ€™m working with Prof. Dinesh Manocha (GAMMA Lab) and Prof. Ramani Duraiswami (PIRL Lab).</p> <p>I graduated from the <a href="https://www.iitb.ac.in/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay (IITB)</a> in 2025 where I worked with Prof. Biplab Banerjee (Deep Visual Computning Lab) and Prof. Preethi Jyothi (CSALT Lab). My previous work involved:</p> <ul> <li>using Deep Generative Models (VAEs, Diffusion Models, DiTs) for generative replay/distillation in anomaly detection for continual learning settings</li> <li>improving audio-visual (AV) alignment for clever scene segmentation and AV retrieval</li> <li>leveraging neural audio codecs to develop semnatically-rich discrete audio representations</li> </ul> </body></html>
