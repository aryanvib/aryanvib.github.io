Machine Learning enthuasiast. MSCS UMD College Park. B.Tech IIT Bombay. Ex: Data Science AMEX, Research Intern Brown University.

I am a MSCS graduate student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.umd.edu/) at the University of Maryland (UMD), College Park. My recent work has focused on **multimodal AI**, more specifically in the space of **Deep Generative Models** (Diffusion Models, GANs) and **model understanding**. Currently, I'm working with [Prof. Dinesh Manocha](https://www.cs.umd.edu/people/dmanocha) (GAMMA Lab) and [Prof. Ramani Duraiswami](https://www.cs.umd.edu/people/ramanid) (PIRL Lab). 

I graduated from the [Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay (IITB)](https://www.iitb.ac.in/) in 2025 where I worked with [Prof. Biplab Banerjee](https://biplab-banerjee.github.io/) (Deep Visual Computning Lab) and [Prof. Preethi Jyothi](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pjyothi/) (CSALT Lab). My previous work involved:
  - using Deep Generative Models (VAEs, Diffusion Models, DiTs) for generative replay/distillation in anomaly detection for continual learning settings
  - improving audio-visual (AV) alignment for clever scene segmentation and AV retrieval
  - leveraging neural audio codecs to develop semnatically-rich discrete audio representations

I was a **Research Intern** with [Prof. Miguel Bessa's](https://vivo.brown.edu/display/mbessa) group (Bessa Research Group) at Brown University in Summer 2023 where I worked on leveraging Diffusion Models for topology optimization.
