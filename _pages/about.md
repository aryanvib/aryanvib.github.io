I am a MSCS graduate student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.umd.edu/) at the University of Maryland (UMD), College Park. My recent work has focused on multimodal AI, more specifically in the space of Deep Generative Models (Diffusion Models, GANs) and model understanding. Currently, I'm working with Prof. Dinesh Manocha (GAMMA Lab) and Prof. Ramani Duraiswami (PIRL Lab). 

I graduated from the [Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay (IITB)](https://www.iitb.ac.in/) in 2025 where I worked with Prof. Biplab Banerjee (Deep Visual Computning Lab) and Prof. Preethi Jyothi (CSALT Lab). My previous work involved:
  - using Deep Generative Models (VAEs, Diffusion Models, DiTs) for generative replay/distillation in anomaly detection for continual learning settings
  - improving audio-visual (AV) alignment for clever scene segmentation and AV retrieval
  - leveraging neural audio codecs to develop semnatically-rich discrete audio representations
